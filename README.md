For this project, I developed an intelligent pirate agent that uses deep Q-learning to find a treasure within a maze environment. The starter code included two main Python classes—TreasureMaze.py, which defined the maze environment and its state transitions, and GameExperience.py, which managed the replay memory storing the agent’s episodes. My task was to complete the Jupyter Notebook by implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm, which involved building the neural network model, defining the training loop, computing rewards, and tuning hyperparameters such as the learning rate, discount factor (γ), and exploration rate (ε). I also added visualization code to track the agent’s learning progress and tested multiple configurations to ensure the pirate could successfully locate the treasure with minimal steps.

Throughout this course, I learned how reinforcement learning (RL) fits into the larger field of computer science by showing how intelligent systems can learn through interaction and feedback instead of explicit programming. Computer scientists design and implement such adaptive algorithms to solve complex real-world problems—from robotics and game AI to autonomous navigation and recommendation systems. This work matters because RL enables technology to make dynamic, data-driven decisions that improve efficiency and adaptability, which are key to innovation across industries.

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I now think systematically: I define the environment, analyze the agent’s state and possible actions, establish measurable goals through a reward function, and iteratively refine the model based on performance data. This structured problem-solving mindset—breaking challenges into logical components and testing solutions empirically—is central to both reinforcement learning and computer science as a discipline.

Ethically, I recognize that computer scientists bear responsibility to ensure that intelligent systems serve users fairly, transparently, and safely. Reinforcement learning systems must be monitored to prevent harmful or biased outcomes, especially when used in areas that affect people’s opportunities or well-being. Balancing innovation with accountability ensures that technology advances while protecting both end users and the organizations that deploy it.
